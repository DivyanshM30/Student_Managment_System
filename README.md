# Student Management System

## Project Overview
The **Student Management System** is a Java-based console application designed to manage student records efficiently. This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, **file handling**, and **basic CRUD operations**. Users can add, update, delete, and search student records with ease.

---

## Features
- **Add Student**: Create new student records with ID, name, age, and course details.
- **View Students**: List all students in the system.
- **Update Student**: Modify student details based on student ID.
- **Delete Student**: Remove a student record from the system.
- **Search Student**: Find student information using student ID or name.
- **Persistent Storage**: Save all student data to a file for later retrieval.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (OOP, Collections, File I/O)
- **Java Console Application**
- Optional: **Java Swing** for GUI enhancement
- File-based storage (CSV or text file)

---

## How It Works
1. On program start, the system loads existing student records from a file.
2. Users interact with a **menu-driven interface** in the console.
3. Each operation (add, update, delete, search) modifies the student data in memory and updates the file.
4. The program ensures data integrity with basic input validation.
